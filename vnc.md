# VNC to Raspberry Pi

In Ubuntu, we'll use tigervncserver to connect. I have tried other solutions, but it seems like tigervnc is the best with headless server mode.

To install ubuntu desktop on the server, run `sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop`
To install TigerVNC Server, run `sudo apt install tigervnc-standalone-server`
