# Resources for Configuring Raspberry Pi 4B
 - `config.txt` the boot config file to save on MicroSD card, or to `/boot/firmware/config.txt` in the system
 - `bootfs-original.zip` contains original boot image
 - `overclock.md` is about overclocking and parameters

(Depreciated) Procedures and notes to install systems are in the `./deprecated-setup-rockylinux` or `./deprecated-setup-ubuntu` directories. We'll use [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) to configure moving forward.
