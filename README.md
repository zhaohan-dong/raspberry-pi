# Install Rocky Linux, Kubernetes and Others on Raspbery Pi 4B

This main readme file will only describe installing Rocky Linux on Raspberry Pi 4B, you can find other readme files in the root directory.

### Description of Rocky Linux
Rocky Linux is an open-source enterprise operating system designed to be 100% bug-for-bug compatible with Red Hat Enterprise LinuxÂ®. It is under intensive development by the community.

### Why Rocky Linux
Rocky Linux is a RHEL compatible OS, likely stabler than Raspberry Pi OS or Ubuntu, with support for RPM packages.<br/>
Note it is also possible to use [Oracle Linux](https://www.oracle.com/linux/downloads/linux-arm-downloads.html) natively on Raspberry Pi.<br/>

### Are Other Systems Available?
Yes, if the Raspberry Pi has UEFI installed.
By installing [Raspberry Pi 4 UEFI Firmware](https://github.com/pftf/RPi4), it's technically possible to install other systems for AArch64. However, it was throwing Synchronous Exceptions during installation attempts of several other OSes.<br/>

## Download Latest Installer
Find the installer at [Rocky Linux Alternative Images Download Page](https://rockylinux.org/alternative-images)<br/>
or<br/>
directly from [Rocky Linux for Raspberry Pi Image](https://dl.rockylinux.org/pub/sig/9/altarch/aarch64/images/RockyLinuxRpi_9-latest.img.xz)<br/>

Load it onto an SD card or USB disk, using [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/), [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), or run on a Unix-like system:<br/>
`dd if=DOWNLOADED_IMAGE of=DISK_NODE_IDENTIFIER bs=1M status=progress`<br/>

Substitute:
- `DOWNLOADED_IMAGE` with file path to the downloaded installer image
- `DISK_NODE_IDENTIFIER` with disk node identifier, for example `/dev/disk6`, find the identifier using `diskutil list` on Mac

## Boot Rocky Linux for the First Time
Plug the storage device into Raspberry Pi.<br/>

Default credentials:<br/>
```
username: rocky
password: rockylinux
```
Run `sudo rootfs-expand` to grow the partition and use all of your memory card or hard drive.<br/>

For official guidance, find readme file at [Rocky 9 Raspberry Pi Image](https://dl.rockylinux.org/pub/sig/9/altarch/aarch64/images/README.txt)<br/>

## Change Host Name and Host File
`hostnamectl set-hostname DESIRED_HOST_NAME`
also change the entry in `/etc/hosts`

## Turn Off Lights
On Rocky Linux, create a new file `/boot/config.txt`, and include the following:<br/>
```
# Turn off red power LED
dtparam=pwr_led_trigger=none
dtparam=pwr_led_activelow=on
# Turn off green activity LED
dtparam=act_led_trigger=none
dtparam=act_led_activelow=off
# Turn off ethernet LEDs
dtparam=eth_led0=4
dtparam=eth_led1=4
```

## Cron & Anacron
Rocky Linux supports both `anacron` and `cron` (looking at you Apple). Check logs at `/var/log/cron`

## Disable Ping (ICMP Requests)
### Recommended Method
Drop ICMP requests without notifying the client.
`sudo firewall-cmd --set-target=DROP --permanent`
`sudo firewall-cmd --reload`
### Un-Recommended Method
Run as root<br/>
IPV4: `echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all`
IPV6: `echo "1" > /prc/sys/net/ipv6/icmp/echo_ignore_all`
See [IP Sysctl - The Linux Kernel](https://docs.kernel.org/networking/ip-sysctl.html) for more details.

To make it persistent, instead of the above, in `/etc/sysctl.conf` set:<br/>
`net.ipv4.icmp_echo_ignore_all = 1`
`net.ipv6.icmp.echo_ignore_all = 1`
