# Raspberry Pi Resources
This repo contains resources to set up Raspberry Pi.

## Where to find stuff
 - `/ansible` Ansible for setting up machines (Too many configurations and I'm a lazy person who tinkers a lot \*yawn\*)
 - `/utils` Common utilities that would be good to install (watchdog, etc.)
 - `/rpi4` Raspberry Pi 4B specific stuff
 - `/rpi5` Raspberry Pi 5 specific stuff
 - `/k8s` has some prev experiment on running k8s on rpi (terrible idea)
